# NLP Algorithm for Customer Satisfaction and Brand Equity

## Overview
This repository contains an NLP-based algorithm designed to analyze Customer Satisfaction and Brand Equity using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model utilizes Llama LLM (Large Language Model) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze text data and predict customer satisfaction and brand equity for large-sized US companies.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes raw text for model input.
- **Model Training:** Implements the Llama LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process the data.
- **Binary Classification:** Predicts binary outcomes, such as customer satisfaction (satisfied or not) and brand equity (positive or negative).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for model evaluation.
- **Model Deployment:** Provides deployment instructions for running the model in a production environment.

To run the NLP algorithm, make sure to install the following dependencies:

- Python >= 3.8
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `spacy`
- `huggingface_hub`
- `openai`

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:
