Customers can purchase EarlyBird Check-in for an additional $12.50 each way (priority boarding privileges are already included in the purchase of a Business Select fare and are a benefit of being an A-List frequent flyer - see ""Southwest's Rapid Rewards Frequent Flyer Program"" above). Southwest's P.A.W.S. offering allows Customers to bring a small cat or dog into the aircraft cabin for a $95 one-way fare. In 2013, as part of the Company's network connectivity efforts, it began enabling Customers to book a small cat or dog into the aircraft cabin on domestic shared itineraries with AirTran. Southwest also charges an additional $50 per one-way trip for unaccompanied minor travel to address the administrative costs and the extra care necessary to safely transport these Customers.

Southwest,2013,"During second quarter 2013, Southwest announced its implementation of a No Show policy that applies to nonrefundable fares that are not canceled or changed by a Customer at least ten minutes prior to a flight's scheduled departure. If a Customer has booked a nonrefundable fare anywhere in his/her itinerary and that portion of the flight is not used and not canceled or changed by the Customer at least ten minutes prior to scheduled departure, all unused funds on the full itinerary will be forfeited, and the remaining reservation will be canceled. This policy does not apply to military fares, senior fares, or travel during certain irregular operations, including severe weather conditions. The No Show policy will not impact Customers who simply cancel a Wanna Get Away or DING! ® fare at least ten minutes prior to scheduled departure; in this case, Customers may reuse their funds toward future travel on Southwest, without a change fee, as they have always done. Customers who are traveling on a fully refundable itinerary that does not contain a Wanna Get Away or DING! fare will continue to have the option of either requesting a refund or holding funds for future travel.
